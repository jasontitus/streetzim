# Running StreetZim on Zimfarm

`streetzim` (`streetzim/cli.py`) is the builder's openZIM-style command. Its
flags follow maps2zim's, and `offliner-definition.json` describes them for
Zimfarm. This page covers what it builds by default, what Zimfarm needs on
its side before it can run it, and what a build costs.

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/out:/output" streetzim \
  streetzim --name osm_en_luxembourg --title Luxembourg \
    --description "Offline map of Luxembourg with search and routing" \
    --include-poly https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/luxembourg.poly \
    --output /output --stats-filename /output/task_progress.json
```

The image is Python 3.14 on Debian trixie, like openZIM's scrapers, so
zimscraperlib is installed and `streetzim` uses it for the metadata rules,
the illustration (PNG, JPEG, WebP or SVG, cropped to 48x48), downloads and
the output-folder check. The ZIM itself is written with python-libzim.

## The default profile

| | default | how |
|---|---|---|
| Vector tiles | built with tilemaker from the OSM extract | or `--mbtiles` for ready-made OpenMapTiles (e.g. OpenFreeMap) |
| Search over every named feature, Find chips, places list | on | always |
| Offline routing (drive / walk / bike) | on, spatial layout (SZCI v3) | `--no-routing` |
| Wikidata place details | off | `--wikidata` (queries Wikidata) |
| Terrain / hillshade | off | `--terrain` (downloads Copernicus DEM tiles) |
| Satellite imagery | **never** | not offered: the imagery is CC BY-NC-SA |

The area is exactly one of `--area` (a preset), `--include-poly` (a `.poly`
URL; a Geofabrik one also selects its extract) or `--bbox`. Areas are
bounding boxes: the extract and the tiles are cut to the box, not the
polygon. So:
- an area that reaches the antimeridian (Russia, Fiji) is refused rather
  than turned into a band around the world;
- a polygon whose parts are far apart is built from the part with the most
  land, and the log names the parts left out. Parts are kept together while
  they are less than 1° apart or their shared box is at most 3 times their
  own boxes: Spain keeps the Balearics and the Canaries, but the
  Netherlands leaves out its Caribbean islands and Portugal the Azores and
  Madeira. Build those separately with `--bbox`;
- a single ring that spans open sea (Norway's includes Svalbard and
  Jan Mayen) gives a large, mostly empty box; prefer a smaller polygon or
  `--bbox`.

`License` metadata and the viewer's credits list only the sources a ZIM
actually contains.

## What Zimfarm needs on its side

Checked against openzim/zimfarm at `917d7bc`:

1. **Docker image name.** Zimfarm pulls `ghcr.io/<name>` and only accepts
   names in `DockerImageName` (`backend/src/zimfarm_backend/common/enums.py`).
   StreetZim's image would have to be published under a name added there
   (for example `openzim/streetzim` if the repository moved to openZIM).
2. **Progress bar.** The worker reads `task_progress.json` only for
   offliners listed in `PROGRESS_CAPABLE_OFFLINERS`
   (`worker/.../common/constants.py`); `stdStats: true` has no effect until
   `streetzim` is added there.
3. **Definition upload.** maps2zim publishes its definition with
   `.github/workflows/update-zim-offliner-definition.yaml`, which calls
   `openzim/overview`'s reusable workflow with a `ZIMFARM_CI_SECRET`. The
   same workflow works here once openZIM provides the secret. The offliner
   is registered with `base_model: DashModel`: Zimfarm passes flags as
   `--flag-name=value` (its `compute_flags`), which also keeps a value
   starting with `-`, such as a western `--bbox`, from being read as a flag.

`offliner-definition.json` validates against Zimfarm's own
`OfflinerSpecSchema` (`tools/check_zimfarm_schema.py`, run in CI against a
pinned Zimfarm commit), and the command line Zimfarm generates from it is
accepted by `streetzim` (`tests/test_offliner_definition.py`).

## What a build costs

Measured with `tools/measure_build.py` on a 4-core, 15 GB machine,
default profile (tilemaker, search, chips, routing), OSM extracts from
openstreetmap.fr on 2026-09-28 (the Netherlands: 2026-09-29), Python
3.11 outside Docker. Memory is PSS
summed over every process of the build (RSS, which counts shared pages
once per worker, in brackets); disk is the temp and output folders (the
downloaded extract is not counted).

| region | OSM extract | wall time | CPU time | peak memory | peak disk | ZIM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Luxembourg | 56 MB | 3.2 min | 6.7 min | 4.0 GB (4.0) | 0.35 GB | 55 MB |
| Switzerland | 679 MB | 70 min | 195 min | 4.6 GB (6.3) | 4.4 GB | 654 MB |
| Netherlands | 1.63 GB | 92 min | 162 min | 10.8 GB (11.2) | 11.0 GB | 1.22 GB |

The Switzerland run shared the machine with low-priority test builds, so
its wall time is an upper bound. 49 of its 70 minutes are the search step
(feature extraction from the tiles, location labels for every named
feature, and addresses from the extract); the next largest are writing
the ZIM (11 min) and the routing graph (5 min).

The Netherlands had the machine to itself. Its time splits between the
search step (40 min) and writing the ZIM (34 min); tiles take 8 min and
routing 7. Writing the ZIM is also where memory and disk peak (10.8 GB
PSS, 11.0 GB): the search step peaks at 5.4 GB PSS (11.2 GB RSS, shared
pages counted per worker) and 8.1 GB of disk. Two earlier runs with less
free disk failed with ENOSPC while writing the ZIM's search index, so for
a region this size
give the task at least 12 GB of RAM and 15 GB of disk, besides the extract
and shapefiles.

### Downloads per task

A fresh Zimfarm container downloads, besides the OSM extract:
- the coastline and Natural Earth shapefiles (about 900 MB, unzipped
  about 1.2 GB) when tiles are built with tilemaker. Baking them into the
  image, or building from `--mbtiles`, avoids this;
- nothing for the viewer: MapLibre GL JS is vendored and the Docker image
  carries the pinned font glyphs ([viewer-supply-chain.md](viewer-supply-chain.md));
- with `--terrain`, Copernicus DEM tiles for the area.
